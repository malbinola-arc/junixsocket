# junixsocket

junixsocket is a Java/JNI library that allows the use of
[Unix Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) (AF_UNIX sockets), and
other address/protocol families (such as [AF_TIPC](http://tipc.io/)), from Java.

## Unix sockets API, in Java, AF.

* *junixsocket* is the most complete implementation of AF_UNIX sockets for the Java ecosystem.
* Supports other socket types, such as TIPC (on Linux), as well!
* Comes with pre-built native libraries for most operating systems and platforms, including
  macOS, Linux, Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, AIX, IBM i.
* Additionally, you can build and run junixsocket natively on IBM z/OS (experimental).
* Supports all Java versions since Java 8.
* Supports both the Java Socket API and NIO (`java.net.Socket`, `java.net.SocketChannel`, etc.)
* Supports streams and datagrams.
* Supports Remote Method Invocation (RMI) over AF_UNIX.
* Supports JDBC database connectors (connect to a local database server via Unix sockets).
    * Generic *AFUNIXSocketFactory* for databases like PostgreSQL
    * Custom socket factory for MySQL Connector/J, as [recommended by Oracle](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-unix-socket.html)
* Supports [peer credentials](https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/peercreds.html).
* Supports sending and receiving [file descriptors](https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/filedescriptors.html).
* Supports the abstract namespace on Linux.
* Supports socketpair, and instantiating socket classes from file descriptors.
* Supports [HTTP over UNIX sockets](https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/http.html) (using [NanoHTTPD](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd), [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp), and [jetty](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/)).
* Supports JPMS/Jigsaw modules. The project is modularized so you can install only what you need.
* Provides a selftest package with 100+ tests to ensure compatibility with any target platform.
* Apache 2.0 licensed.

`*` (Tested up to Java 19; support for Java 7 was dropped in version 2.5.0).

Commercial support is available through [Kohlsch√ºtter Search Intelligence](http://www.kohlschutter.com/).

## Self-test

To verify that the software works as expected on your platform, you can run the
[junixsocket-selftest](https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/selftest.html) program, which is
located in the "junixsocket-dist" distribution package, and also released on GitHub.

```
java -jar junixsocket-selftest-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
```

(with VERSION being the corresponding junixsocket version).

## Maven dependency
